    You book it past the doll. You’re not much of a runner but you know there’s no going back. As your running away, you chance a glance over your shoulder only to see the doll gone, even so you continue to sprint home. You don’t stop until you make it home. As you struggle to get your key in the lock you continue to take deep, raged breathes. Once you are finally able to unlock the front door you shove it open and slam it shut. This is when you finally take a moment to catch your breath.

    Following your instincts to run has saved you. This incident will haunt you for a few months but eventually you forget all about it. You’ll continue your life without any lasting effects… lucky you.
