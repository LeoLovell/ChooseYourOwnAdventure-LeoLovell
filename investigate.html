    You decide walk towards the doll and investigate it. It must have some sort of mechanism that allows the doll to move, especially to move across a street. As you bend down to pick up the doll, you your vision blur. When your hand finally makes contact with the doll, everything goes black.

  <p>
    You open your eyes to see a whiteness. As you sit up you feel your head pound. Your realize that you're surrounded by a bright whiteness. You feel a floor under you but there appears to be no walls. You stand despite the pounding in your head. As you take in your surroundings a feeling of dread comes upon you. You’re stuck in an endless white void of nothingness. You’ll spend the rest of eternity searching this white landscape. This is the punishment for your curiosity.
