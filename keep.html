    You have an iron grip on the Doll as the world around goes black. You feel your legs give out, but you’ve completely blackout before you hit the ground. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When you wake up the first thing you notice is the mugginess of the environment which is strange because it has rained in weeks. As your vision clears you take in your surroundings. You discover that you lay on the ground of some sort of tunnel and, by the smell, it must be a sewer. You’ve been transported to the sewer system under your town.
  </p>

  <p>
    Turns out curiosity does kill the cat because you’ve been trapped in the sewers for the rest of time, forever wandering the complex system of tunnels waiting for death to set you free.
