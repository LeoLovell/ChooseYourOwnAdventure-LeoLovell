    As you feel your body start to sway and your vision becomes blurry you have enough sense to throw the doll. It flies only a couple feet — your not much of a pitcher — but it’s enough for dizziness and blurriness to stop. You stand there, collecting yourself. Once the shock and fear start to wean you take off, running as fast as you can towards your house.

Because of your divisive action you are able to dodge an aginiving fate, but the situation has left you traumatized. You’ll need a few sessions of therapy in order to get a goodnight sleep again. <i>This’ll cost a lot but surely the alternative is worse wright?</i>
