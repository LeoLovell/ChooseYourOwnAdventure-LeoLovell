    You walk across the street keeping an eye on the doll. You don’t know why or how but can feel it in your gut that you can’t look away from the doll. When you finally step onto the sidewalk on the other side of the street, you breathe a sigh of relief. However, when you turn to walk forward to continued your walk home you see the doll ahead of you. It sits just as it had before. You once again have a choice to make.

  <h2>

        Run past the doll to get home? </a> </li>
      <li> <a href="investigate.html" >
        Walk to the doll and investigate it? </a> </li>
    </ol>
