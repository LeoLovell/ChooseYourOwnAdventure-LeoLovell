    The fear seeps into every fiber of your being and paralyzes you. You stand there frozen for the foreseeable future. You don’t move and time passes without you. The town grows and changes around you and you stay in still, unmoving. You become a landmark in the town. Just another statue in the town, a monument.

    <b>Congratulations,</b> you have chosen the most boring ending! You chose the only choice that wasn’t an action. <i>You’ve chosen the most dull, uninteresting choose. What does this say about you?</i>
